			<p>When two laws appear to disagree in their<lb/> terms,
				<del>it is</del>
			a great question is often made<lb/> whether they are or are not repugnant. The<lb/> occasion<del>s</del> on which it is brought upon the carpet<lb/>
			<!-- it is the provisional policy of Transcribe Bentham to treat line-end hyphenation in this fashion -->

			superior<lb/>
				<del>which</del>
			the other from a superior legislature.<lb/> The question then is
				<add>in truth</add>
			[properly speaking] a
				<add>great</add>
			question<lb/> of constitutional law; but since the word which is<lb/> the subject of it is

				<add>law</add>
